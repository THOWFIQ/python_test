I am writing to provide an update regarding the Order Date Function executed for the date range:
From Date: 2025-07-29
To Date: 2025-07-29
Upon execution, the function successfully retrieved a total of 46 sales order records. However, the associated datasets returned the following counts:
Fulfillment Records: 46
Sales Header Records: 46
Vendor Master Records: 7
ASN Header Records: 10
Work Order Records: 23
ASN Detail Records: 6
While the primary sales order data is complete, we are currently facing challenges in accurately mapping related records such as vendor, ASN, and work order details. The existing logic relies on index-based mapping, which is proving unreliable due to the mismatch in record counts across datasets.
For example:
The 30th sales order correctly maps to a vendor record.
The 15th sales order also maps correctly.
However, other records do not align consistently, leading to incorrect associations.
This issue requires a shift from index-based mapping to key-based matching using identifiers such as salesOrderId, vendorSiteId, asnId, and workOrderId. Implementing this change will involve restructuring the data processing logic and validating relationships across all datasets.
Given the complexity, I anticipate that resolving this issue will take significant time and effort, and it is unlikely to be completed within an hour. I will continue working on refining the mapping logic and will share progress updates as the solution evolves.
